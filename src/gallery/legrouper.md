resume: 'For the company "Le Groupe®" I had to create the most cost effective content management system I could with craft, that will allow the site manager to create pages for his works, display the play dates. I handled the design of the site with craft, let Craft CMS handle the backend, and I configured a Hetzner LAMP server with Ubuntu.'
