# Ecology is key 

As of 2023, ecology seems to have lost a bit of interest from people. The ecology manifestation for climate at Brussels, was seen it's population cut by half.
Meanwhile, humanity gets closer and closer to this wall no one wants to see. #society. 

But what can we do ? I guess we can apply to on ecological organisation, or reduce your meat consumption, be aware about your gaz and electricity, or orient your work towards this purpose. 

This last option has been on my mind for a while now : How can I be an actor of the digital world, taking part in an industry led by Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Google and still be in connection with my ecological values ?
