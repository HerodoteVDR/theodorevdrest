## Hello ! And welcome ! 

The purpose of this blog is to share my work and my thoughts [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a great static site generator. I discovered through [JÃ©rÃ´me CoupÃ©'s introduction to eleventy](https://github.com/jeromecoupe/iad_eleventy_introduction/blob/master/eleventy_introduction_en.md). So how did i created the website ?

### This is for an example to show off the possibilities :

I can, for example put an image I like or something like that : 

![It can be fun](https://www.legroupe-r.com/uploads/common/_500x500_crop_center-center_none/JBO3.jpg)

#### Or it can be code :

```javascript

var nicolas = {
    firstname: "Nicolas",
    name: "Dupont",
    birthdate: "31/07/00",
};

function whoisthis(person){
    console.log(person.name);
}

whoisthis(nicolas);

```
